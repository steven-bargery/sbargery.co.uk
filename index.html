<h1>Welcome to sbargery.co.uk</h1>

<p>This is a static website hosted on AWS using a serverless architecture. It utilises the following AWS services:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li><b>S3</b> - for hosting the actual content of the website</li>
    <li><b>CloudFront</b> - for distributing the content from the S3 bucket (origin) and providing a secure connection (HTTPS)</li>
    <li><b>Route 53</b> - for routing the requests for sbargery.co.uk and www.sbargery.co.uk to the Cloudfront distributions</li>
    <li><b>ACM</b> - for the SSL certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see it's very bare at the moment. Over the next few weeks I plan to develop this website to host my resume, updating it through GitHub with CI/CD. It will also use AWS's API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB services.</p>
